## 📄 Description

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The **Minishell** project is a simple, custom-built shell that emulates the basic functionalities of a Unix shell. It allows users to **execute commands, handle piping, redirect input/output, and manage processes with built-in functionalities**. The goal of this project is to understand how shells interact with the operating system and the intricacies of process management, file handling, and system calls. By building Minishell, **developers can learn how to implement core features like command parsing, executing commands, and handling signals**. It is a great project to improve your understanding of C programming and low-level operating system interactions while creating a useful and functional command-line interface.
